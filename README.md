# amem (agent memory)

## What this is

A command-line tool that gives an LLM agent memory.

## Stack

- Go
- sqlite
- [urfave/cli/v3](https://github.com/urfave/cli) for the CLI
- [go-sqlcipher](https://github.com/mutecomm/go-sqlcipher) for encrypting the database
- [go-keyring](https://github.com/zalando/go-keyring) for OS keychain integration

## Configuration

Config is stored as JSON and specifies the database path. amem discovers config in this order:

1. **Local config** (project-specific): `.amem/config.json` â€“ searched by walking up the directory tree from the current directory
2. **Global config** (user-wide): `~/.config/amem/config.json`

The first config found is used. Once located, amem reads the database path from `db_path` in the config and loads the encrypted database from that location. The encryption key is retrieved from the OS keychain (stored under service `amem`), or falls back to the `AMEM_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable if the keyring is unavailable.

Use `amem init` to create a config file.

## Database schema

| Table | Columns |
|-------|---------|
| entities | id, text |
| observations | id, entity_id, text, timestamp |
| relationships | id, from_id, to_id, type, timestamp |


## Encryption

The database is always fully encrypted using [go-sqlcipher](https://github.com/mutecomm/go-sqlcipher).
