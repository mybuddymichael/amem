# Agent guide

**IMPORTANT**: Before anything, read README.md for details about the project.

- Be extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- We track work in Beads instead of Markdown. Run `bd quickstart` before anything else to see how.
- Set the bead issue as in progress when starting work.
- Set the bead issue as closed before committing.
- Use `mise` for all build and test-related commands.
- Before committing, run `mise run check`.
